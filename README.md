# aTrainingTracker
An android app for tracking your sports activities (supporting ANT+ and BTLE)


This Android app is for the really serious athletes. 

For those, who want to track all the details of every training session but do not want to waste their time.  
This app is for all the athletes, who want a powerful yet simple to use app to track their training.


Once configured and paired with all your remote sensors, you only have to press start when you start your 
training session and stop when you are done.  Except for the name of the workout, everything else should go 
without further interaction.  The app automagically determines the sport and the equipment (shoe or bike) 
you used during a training session based on the remote sensors that where used during this session. Moreover, 
the app can upload the files to your Dropbox.  So when you have finished your shower, the data is already on 
your computer, waiting to be analyzed with your favorite software like WKO+, or Golden Cheetah.
